SELECT Person.Name FROM Student, Person WHERE Student.PersonID = Person.PersonID ORDER BY Person.PersonID ASC

// returns names of teachers
SELECT Person.Name FROM Teacher, Person WHERE Teacher.PersonID = Person.PersonID

// select all unnasigned students

INNER JOIN Student ON Student.PersonID = Person.PersonID
WHERE Student.isAssigned = 0;

// unassigned all students
UPDATE Student
SET isAssigned = 0
WHERE Student.isAssigned = 1

// number of unassigned students?
Select DISTINCT Count(*) FROM Person
INNER JOIN Student ON Student.PersonID = Person.PersonID

reverse engineer import csv to allow for backups

TO LOOP THROUGH RESULTS SET:
while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println(rs.getInt("id") +  "\t" + 
                                   rs.getString("name") + "\t" +
                                   rs.getDouble("capacity"));
